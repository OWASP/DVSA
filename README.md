## a Damn Vulnerable Serverless Application 

- - -
Damn Vulnerable Serverless Application (DVSA) is a deliberately vulnerable application aiming to be an aid for security professionals to test their skills and tools in a legal environment, help developers better understand the processes of securing serverless applications and to aid both students & teachers to learn about serverless application security in a controlled class room environment.

The aim of DVSA is to **practice some of the most common serverless vulnerabilities**, with a simple straightforward interface.

Please note, there are **both documented and undocumented vulnerabilities** with this software. This is intentional. You are encouraged to try and discover as many issues as possible.
